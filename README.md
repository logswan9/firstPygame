# firstPygame
My first game using pygame.
So I decided to learn python using pygame. This is a simple game in which you control a space ship with the arrow keys
and pressing the space bar allows the player to shoot a laser that can destroy incoming asteroids.
The game tracks how much score you accumulate and displays it on screen in the top left corner. You get a 100 points for each asteroid you destroy.
The game also has a shield system in which you can take 4 hits from asteroids until you have no shields left. If you get hit 
once more after that, you die and the game ends. Shields are displayed as a percent in the top right corner.
I had a lot of ideas I wanted to try out with this game, yet I do not know the pygame module very well. So, it was hard implementing
certain ideas. There are a lot of commented out lines that I want to keep in there, incase I need something to go off in the future.
